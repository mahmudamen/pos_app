## Overview

Bayaa POS is a Flutter desktop application for retail businesses that need dependable checkout, stock control, invoices, refunds, reporting, and user access management—without relying on an internet connection or external server.

The application stores its data locally in SQLite, supports Arabic and English interfaces, and is designed for fast day-to-day work at the counter.

### Design principles

- **Feature-first organization** keeps each business capability easy to locate and evolve.
- **Cubit and BLoC state management** keeps UI state predictable and reactive.
- **Repository and service layers** isolate persistence, backup, printing, and operational logic.
- **Local-first persistence** keeps checkout and inventory workflows available without a server.
- **Localization and RTL** are treated as application-wide behavior, not a screen-specific add-on.

## Data and reliability

Bayaa POS creates and maintains its SQLite database locally. It includes backup and restore support, checkpointing, and an activity log for operational events such as sales, refunds, restocks, user activity, and session changes.

Main data groups include store settings, users, products, categories, shifts, sales, sale items, and activity logs.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or later
- Flutter SDK compatible with Dart `^3.6.1`
- Visual Studio 2022 with the **Desktop development with C++** workload

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Desha29/Bayaa.git
cd Bayaa
flutter pub get
flutter run -d windows
```

On first launch, choose a safe location for the application data. Bayaa POS creates and manages its local data files there.

### Build a release

```bash
flutter build windows --release
```

The Windows release is created under:

```text
build/windows/x64/runner/Release/
```

### Verify changes

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

For UI changes, also run the Windows application and verify both English and Arabic layouts.
